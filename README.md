# clEar: Utilizing Glasses-embedded Beamformers to Improve Speech Clarity and Spatial Context for the Hearing Impaired

This repository contains code for clEar. All important code is in the beamformingarray folder. There are available demos under ./beamformingarray/AudioTests/Demo and the code used to generate them can be found at the bottom of the file ./beamformingarray/beamformingarray/BeamformerMSMVDR.py

Also, I intended to name the prototype EyeHear (Because Glasses + Hearing), but that was taken by project that translated speech and projected it onto the lens of a pair of glasses. I have not changed the repository name yet.
